# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

The Purpose of this new analysis is to find and show trends in Pyber usages across the three city types so that disparities can be found. Resources and fundings can then be better allocated to the type of cities that are in need of further assistance.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

An immediate difference that can be seen is on the pyber_summary_df when it comes to the average fare per ride and total drivers for Rural cities and Urban cities. The total amount of drivers for Urban cities (2,405) is thirty times higher compared to that of Rural cities (78), but the average fare per ride is only $10.09 difference for the two city categories. In contrast, average fare per driver is much higher for the Rural cities at $55.49 per driver, more than 3 times higher than the average fare per driver for Urban cities.

For the multiple-line chart, there seems to be some fluctuations in terms of usage at the end of the month of Febuary to the beginning of April, more so for Urban cities compared to both Suburban and Rural. Suburban also had the most noticeable spike in usage right at the end of February to March.








## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
