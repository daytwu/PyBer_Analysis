# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.

The Purpose of this new analysis is to find and show trends in Pyber usages across the three city types so that disparities can be found. Resources and fundings can then be better allocated to the type of cities that are in need of further assistance.

## Results: Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.

An immediate difference that can be seen is on the pyber_summary_df when it comes to the average fare per ride and total drivers for Rural cities and Urban cities. The total amount of drivers for Urban cities (2,405) is thirty times higher compared to that of Rural cities (78), but the average fare per ride is only $10.09 difference for the two city categories. In contrast, average fare per driver is much higher for the Rural cities at $55.49 per driver, more than 3 times higher than the average fare per driver for Urban cities.

For the multiple-line chart, there seems to be some fluctuations in terms of usage at the end of the month of Febuary to the beginning of April, more so for Urban cities compared to both Suburban and Rural. Suburban also had the most noticeable spike in usage right at the end of February to March. The total fares for Urban cities are also almost five to six times higher than Rural cities at any given weeks.

## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.

One of the main problems for Rural cities seems to be the lack of driver avaialability in the area, which the high average fare per driver attests to. Perhaps there can be more resources allocated to Rural cities to help drive Pyber usage up in those cities, such as with marketing and advertisement to increase driver hires and make everything more accessible to the populance.

Marketing and advertisement as mentioned above can also help with getting the word out to potential future Pyber users, not just driver hires. One of the biggest issues for advertisement in non Urban cities are that advertisement tends to be spread by mainly word of mouth. Increasing fundings and efforts in marketing and advertisements might cost more with a not as much of a return, but this is a business opportunity that should not be overlooked at.

Finally, there could be bonus incentives given out to drivers in non-Urban cities to encourage drivers to be more availabile during certain times of the year. Looking at the fares and overall usage in the above chart, more people seems to be using Pyber whenever there seems to be weather changes in a month, from when the weather is cold, to stable to being warmer, people seems more willing to hail a ride with sudden weather changes.
